        <h2><b>Impact</b> of Landfills</h2>
        <p><b>Landfills</b> contribute significantly to environmental degradation through soil and water contamination, methane emissions,
             and other hazards.
<br>
<br>
<b>Landfill</b> pollution refers to the environmental contamination that results from waste disposal sites, or landfills, where household,
 industrial, and hazardous wastes are deposited. When waste decomposes in landfills, it releases pollutants into the air, soil, and water,
  which can harm ecosystems and human health.
<br>
<br><b>Key</b> pollutants include methane gas, a potent greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change, and leachate, a toxic liquid formed
 as waste decomposes and mixes with rainwater. Leachate can seep into the ground, contaminating nearby soil and water sources. Additionally,
  improper waste management can lead to the release of heavy metals, chemicals, and plastics, which can persist in the environment for decades,
   posing long-term risks to wildlife and water quality.
       <br>
    <br><b>Reducing </b>landfill pollution involves measures like recycling, composting, waste reduction, and the proper treatment of hazardous
     materials, which help minimize the environmental impact of waste disposal. </p>
