        <h2>Pollution Issues from Solid Waste</h2>
        <p><b>Improper</b> waste management contributes to air, water, and soil pollution. Toxic substances from waste impact ecosystems and human
             health.</p>
        <h2>Disposal of Waste</h2>
        <p>
            <b>The</b> process of waste handling and disposal varies in different countries. In India, the processes differ according to the source
             of solid waste. They can be classified as:
            <br>
            <ul>
            <li> Municipal Solid Waste. </li>
            
            <li> Hazardous Solid Waste.</li>
        </ul>
            
            <b>Municipal</b> solid waste can further be divided into biodegradable, recyclable and hazardous domestic wastes. The biodegradable
             waste includes rotten food, vegetable peel and mostly wet kitchen waste. Recyclable waste includes plastic and hazardous wastes
              include, bulb, batteries, etc. <br> 
            <br>
            
            <b>The</b> industry generated waste from chemical factories, medical waste from hospitals are considered as Hazardous Solid Waste and 
            they need special settings to dispose of them. <br>
            <br>
            
            <b>In</b> any region, solid waste management is very important for the safe disposal of wastes and to reduce environmental pollution
             and avoid any health hazards that it may cause. <br> 
            <br>
            
            <b>Landfills</b> are the most common method of disposing of solid wastes. Modern-day landfills are designed by taking care of various
             environmental factors and types of wastes, so as to minimise pollution and health risks. <br>
            <br>
            <b>Also Refer:</b> Waste Disposal <br>
            <br>
            
            <h2>Effects of Poor Solid Waste Management</h2>
            <b>Due</b> to improper disposal of solid waste particularly by waste management organizations, the collected wastes gets heap up and
             become a problem for both the environment and also for the public.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>By</b> dumping of huge garbage, drives biodegradable materials to decay and decompose under abnormal, uncontrolled and unhygienic 
            conditions. After a few days of decomposition, it becomes a breeding ground for different types of disease-causing insects as well as 
            infectious organisms. A foul smell is produced and it also spoils the aesthetic value of the area.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>The</b> solid wastes collected from different industries include toxic metals, chemicals, and other hazardous wastes. When these
             wastes are released into the environment, they can produce biological and physicochemical problems to the environment, the chemicals 
             may drain into the soil and pollute the groundwater and also alter the productivity of the soils in that particular area.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>In</b> rare cases,  the hazardous wastes may get mixed up with the ordinary garbage and other combustible wastes causing the
             disposal process even harder and risky.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>By</b> burning the paper and other scraps along with the hazardous wastes, dioxins and poisonous gasses are produced and released
             into the air which results in causing various diseases including chronic disease, skin infections, cancer, etc.
