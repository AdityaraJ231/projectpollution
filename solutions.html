        <h2>How to Manage and Reduce Waste</h2>
        <p><b>Implementing </b>recycling programs, composting, and using biodegradable materials can help reduce the environmental impact of
             waste.</p>
        <h2>Composting</h2>
        <p>
            
<b>A </b>biological process in which the organic portion of refuse is allowed to decompose under carefully controlled conditions. Microbes
 metabolize the organic waste material and reduce its volume by as much as 50 percent. The stabilized product is called compost or humus.
  It resembles potting soil in texture and odour and may be used as a soil conditioner or mulch.

<b>Composting</b> offers a method of processing and recycling both garbage and sewage sludge in one operation. As more stringent environmental
 rules and siting constraints limit the use of solid-waste incineration and landfill options, the application of composting is likely to increase.
  The steps involved in the process include sorting and separating, size reduction, and digestion of the refuse.
        </p>
        <h2>Sorting and shredding</h2>

            <br>
<b>The</b> decomposable materials in refuse are isolated from glass, metal, and other inorganic items through sorting and separating operations.
 These are carried out mechanically, using differences in such physical characteristics of the refuse as size, density, and magnetic properties.
  Shredding or pulverizing reduces the size of the waste articles, resulting in a uniform mass of material. It is accomplished with hammer mills
   and rotary shredders.
        </p>
        <h2>Digesting and processing</h2>

        <br>
            
<b>Pulverized </b>waste is ready for composting either by the open windrow method or in an enclosed mechanical facility. Windrows are long, low
 mounds of refuse. They are turned or mixed every few days to provide air for the microbes digesting the organics. Depending on moisture
  conditions, it may take five to eight weeks for complete digestion of the waste. Because of the metabolic action of aerobic bacteria,
   temperatures in an active compost pile reach about 65 °C (150 °F), killing pathogenic organisms that may be in the waste material.
<h2>Sanitary landfill</h2>

<p>
    
    <b>Land </b>disposal is the most common management strategy for municipal solid waste. Refuse can be safely deposited in a sanitary landfill,
     a disposal site that is carefully selected, designed, constructed, and operated to protect the environment and public health. One of the most
      important factors relating to landfilling is that the buried waste never comes in contact with surface water or groundwater. Engineering
       design requirements include a minimum distance between the bottom of the landfill and the seasonally high groundwater table. Most new 
       landfills are required to have an impermeable liner or barrier at the bottom, as well as a system of groundwater-monitoring wells.
        Completed landfill sections must be capped with an impermeable cover to keep precipitation or surface runoff away from the buried waste.
         Bottom and cap liners may be made of flexible plastic membranes, layers of clay soil, or a combination of both.
